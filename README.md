Application objective

The project came to live to help with serial number and operations tracability in manufacturing enviroment. The pen and paper method was ineffective and the databese model seemed to be an ideal solution
The aim is to give the operators a tool for quick and easy way of recording which parts and when have been processed.


Challange

The user interface has to be as simple and minimalistic as possible so the data input would be very easy and take as little time as possible.
I tried to find the ways to auto fill as many information as possible. The application uses the logged in user as the person who "signs" the operation.
It also records time and date of the signature.
The parts can be recognized and called by serial number or an "FG" (project) code.



Tools used

The project has been built using Django framework.
It also utilises Bootstrap4 and Jinga2

To do

Next thing to do is an ability of inputting multiple parts in one go. At the moment the input of each part has to be confirmed with the "sign" button.
